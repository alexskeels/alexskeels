Hi, I'm a biodiversity scientist and evolutionary biologist currently working as a postdoc in the [Macroevolution and Macroecology Group](http://www.macroevoeco.com/) at the [Australian National University](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/divisions/ecology-and-evolution) (ANU). I'll be beginning an ARC DECRA Fellowship in 2025 looking at how environmental changes shapes the origin and decline of biodiversity across the Asia-Pacific region.

I focus on exploring biodiversity patterns and the evolutionary histories of the plant and animal groups that shape them. For an example of my recent research, you can check out this [link](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1301/full). My primary interest lies in the origins of biodiversity hotspots, such as those in **[tropical rainforests]{style="color:green;"}** , **[mountain ranges]{style="color:purple;"}**, and **[Mediterranean-type ecosystems]{style="color:orange;"}**. I also investigate how these regions and their organisms are affected by global change. To address these topics, I use spatial, phylogenetic, and ecological-trait data combined with **simulation modeling** and **phylogenetic comparative analyses**.
