Hi, I'm a biodiversity scientist and evolutionary biologist currently working as a postdoc in the [Macroevolution and Macroecology Group](http://www.macroevoeco.com/) at the [Australian National University](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/divisions/ecology-and-evolution) (ANU). I'll be beginning an ARC DECRA Fellowship in 2025 looking at how environmental changes shapes the origin and decline of biodiversity across the Asia-Pacific region.

I'm interested in exploring biodiversity patterns and the evolutionary histories of the plant and animal groups that contribute to them. You can find an example of some of my most recent research [here](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1301/full). One of my main interests is the origins of *biodiversity hotspots*, such as those found in tropical rainforests, mountain ranges, or Mediterranean-type ecosystems. I am also interested in understanding how these regions, and the organisms within them, are vulnerable to global change. To explore these topics, I analyse spatial, phylogenetic, and ecological-trait data with *simulation modelling* and *phylogenetic* *comparative* *analyses*.

## Current Research

#### Indo-Australian Biogeography

The Indo-Australian region is one of the most geologically and biologically complex areas on the planet. This region is defined by its insularity and the thousands of islands that exist bewteen the Sunda continental shelf and the Australian mainland. The region has been shaped by historical isolation of the Indian subcontinent and Sahul and dramatic biotic interchanges upon their more recent connections with Eurasia. I am deeply interested in understanding how these dynamic tectonic processes, alongside climatic change during teh Cenozoic, have shaped the interchange of organisms in this region, shaping the diversity of different biomes from the equatorial rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, to the monsoonal tropics of Northern Australia, and the central Australian arid zone.

#### Biodiversity Simulation Modelling

Simulation-based approaches to modelling the diversification of lineages allows us to link a complex array of ecological and evolutionary processes. I have been involved in developing new simulation tools (e.g., DREaD) and extending existing simulation frameworks to model novel processes (e.g., Gen3sis) in order to understand how fundamental processes such as environmental niche evolution and dispersal shape emergent biodiversity gradients. My upcoming DECRA aims at extending this toolkit for biogeographers and evolutionary biologists.

#### Phylogenetics and Evolutionary History of the Proteaceae

The Proteaceae are one of the most diverse and iconic temperate plant families. They are found across large areas of the former Gondwanan southern continents and even into parts of tropical Asia. As part of my current ARC funded postdoc I have been inferring phylogenetic relationships in the large, mostly Australian subfamily, the Grevilleoideae.  Using phylogenomic data, we aiming to untangling the causes of widespread discordance throughout the group and date divergences using a novel fossil dataset, in order to look at the groups biogeographic and diversification history in the context of historical biome change.
