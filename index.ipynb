        "Hi, I'm a biodiversity scientist and evolutionary biologist currently working as a postdoc in the [Macroevolution and Macroecology Group](http://www.macroevoeco.com/) at the [Australian National University](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/divisions/ecology-and-evolution) (ANU). I'll be beginning an ARC DECRA Fellowship in 2025 looking at how environmental changes shapes the origin and decline of biodiversity across the Asia-Pacific region.\n",

        "I focus on exploring biodiversity patterns and the evolutionary histories of the plant and animal groups that shape them. For an example of my recent research, you can check out this [link](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1301/full). My primary interest lies in the origins of biodiversity hotspots, such as those in **[tropical rainforests]{style=\"color:green;\"}** , **[mountain ranges]{style=\"color:purple;\"}**, and **[Mediterranean-type ecosystems]{style=\"color:orange;\"}**. I also investigate how these regions and their organisms are affected by global change. To address these topics, I use spatial, phylogenetic, and ecological-trait data combined with **simulation modeling** and **phylogenetic comparative analyses**.\n",
